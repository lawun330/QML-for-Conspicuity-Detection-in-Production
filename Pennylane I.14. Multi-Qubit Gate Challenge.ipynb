    "In the **quantum multiplexer** operation, all $2^n$ possible cases of $n$ control qubits are implemented, and the target operation is a single-qubit rotation (a uniformly controlled rotation).\n",

    "- If the first two qubits are both $|0\\rangle$, do nothing\n",

    "\n",
    "NOTE: No `if` statement!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "1. $|01\\rangle$: To distinguish '01' from '11', we create two Pauli-X operations: one to modify state to distinguish; one to return to the unmodified state. Between those state preparations, there is the Toffoli gate. The idea is that,\n",

    "    So, only if the first two qubits is '01', it can become '11' and hence, the operation. Any other states will not convert to '11' to make the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $|10\\rangle$: Once again, '10' is converted into '11' temporarily for the same reason. Any other states will not convert to '11' to make the operation. The Hadamard gate is applied to the target qubit to create a superposition. When this is combined with the Toffoli operation, the result is the Pauli-Z operation. After the `PauliZ()` equivalent operations, the states 'target superposition' and '11', are undone by adding another Hadamard and X gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $|11\\rangle$: This time, we prepare only the target qubit. The target qubit is rotated around the Z-axis for $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians as the S gate is applied. The purpose of the adjoint S gate to reverse the state preparation effect after the operation. The combined effect of the S and Toffoli gates is the required `PauliY()`."
