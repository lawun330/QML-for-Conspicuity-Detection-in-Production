### Project Solution:
With limited internet access and time, we finished three of the five project deliverables:
1. We finish the codebook sections “Introduction to Quantum Computing”, “Single-Qubit
 Gates” and “Circuits with Many Qubits” from the [PennyLane Codebook](https://pennylane.ai/codebook/). The repository contains the corresponding notebooks for this task. They are named with an initial of `Pennylane I... .ipynb`.
2. We implement and present the usual steps of the tutorial [Variational Classifier](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_variational_classifier/) with our own words. The notebook file is named `Task 2. Variational_Classifier.ipynb`. Necessary data is in the directory `variational_classifier`.
3. We implement and present our steps in a notebook and comment on the important steps for the tutorial [Quanvolutional Neural Networks](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quanvolution/). The notebook file is named `Task 3. Quanvolutional_Neural_Networks.ipynb` and the directory `quanvolution` contains quantum pre-processed data.

In this project, we, `Myanmar Youths`, reproduce the PennyLane tutorials the way we understand. In future, we hope to spread the quantum knowledge and the PennyLane library among quantum-computing enthusiasts from Myanmar. 
To achieve our goal, we consider to-
- create notebooks from existing tutorials,
- add our understandings to the documentation,
- translate them into the *Burmese* language.

However, we did not achieve our goal in time as our translation process is not finished. But this process will be continued after the project submission.
All necessary code files and any additional information required to judge our project solution are included in the repository.
